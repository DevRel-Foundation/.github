  <summary>Why a Foundation?</summary>

  The major benefit of a foundation is that it promotes participatory governance, preventing any single company from monopolizing a collaborative project. Specifically, a foundation ensures:

  - Community-driven Governance: Projects are managed by the community for the community, with contributions reviewed and accepted based on merit.

  - Open Source: Contributors can use the project's resources without fearing sudden changes in licensing or direction.

  - Impartiality: contributions to the content and direction are accepted based on their community value, regardless of their impact on any particular vendor.

  This initiative stems from a shared passion for DevRel and the recognition that the profession faces persistent challenges, such as a lack of clarity and difficulty in measuring impact. Despite significant growth in resources and organizations addressing these issues, these resources are fragmented. Our goal is to create an inclusive, community-driven entity that formally defines DevRel practices, addresses common challenges with best-in-practice resources, and attracts both individuals and organizations’ decision-makers. A foundation aims to be a trusted, credible, and expert resource, similar to professional bodies in other fields, providing training, certification, continuing education, and advocacy.

  <summary>Why Linux Foundation?</summary>

  The major benefit of hosting with the Linux Foundation (LF) is that it offers recognized global credibility. Specifically, the LF ensures:

  - **DevRel value outside DevRel**: Being part of a renowned and large open source foundation like the Linux Foundation enhances the project's credibility within the DevRel community and among external stakeholders and decision-makers. This recognition elevates DevRel's visibility and perceived value as a profession, demonstrating its importance and impact beyond industry peers.

  - **Level Playing Field**: Ensuring that no single company in the ecosystem can exert undue control over the project by owning the trademark.

  - **Licensing Integrity**: Protecting the licensing integrity of the collaborative project, as detailed in this [LF blog post](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/how-open-source-foundations-protect-the-licensing-integrity-of-open-source-projects).

  The Linux Foundation allows individual contributors to retain copyright ownership of their contributions while providing an open source license, reflected through the Developer Certificate of Origin sign-off process.

  This collaborative project has been hosted as a [community project](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/projects/hosting), with no funding involved. This means taking advantage of the governance structure, project management staff, and back-end resources that the LF provides to all hosted projects, to ensure long-term sustainability. Examples of these projects include [SPDX()] (SBOM Standard), FOSSology, or CHAOSS.
  
  We also chose the LF to avoid reinventing the wheel. Creating something new requires tools, infrastructure, and, ideally, a lightweight process to get started and make the initiative resilient.

  <summary>Who is the current Steering Committee?</summary>
  
  This first, non-official Interim SC, composed of tenured Developer Relations professionals, has initiated this “intent to form foundation” built through the LF’s guidance and principles. Once the charter and mission are in place, a new Leadership council will be established. This process will be via elections at a future date to be determined.

  While our profession is relatively small, it is big enough that there are many really good people who can do this work. And we hope they want to! We had the initiative and time to do this, and so we feel it’s reasonable for us, just like anyone else, to take the first steps forward on building something

  Our aim has always been to thread the needle on process and progress - we wanted to get enough done that we, as a professional collective, had a base and some scaffolding from which to build, but not too much progress that folks felt we had prematurely made decisions.

<details>
  <summary>What have you accomplished to date?</summary>
  To date we have accomplished the following:

  - Formed an initial, no-official interim steering committee of tenured DevRel professionals with the shared goal of solving critical DevRel problems through the formation of a Foundation
  - Secured support from the Linux Foundation to have the DevRel Foundation hosted by them
  - Drafted a lightweight charter and took a first pass at organizational structure to provide the broader DevRel community with a starting point from which to work
  - Identified tools and lightweight processes get work done: Discord, GitHub, gitvote, and groups.io
  - Scheduled and facilitated open bi-weekly sessions to listen and learn (alternating APAC/EMEA and AMER)
</details>

  <summary>How do you relate to other existing initiatives?</summary>

  **This is still _a WIP answer_ and needs further discussion in the community calls and async**

  As we explored how best to address the persistent challenges faced by the practice of DevRel, the first thing we did as an interim steering committee was a survey of the existing communities and organizations, including the Developer Marketing Alliance, DevRelX, marketingto.dev, Devrellers and Developer Evangelists (LinkedIn groups), the DevRel Collective, developerrelations.com, flyless.dev, and DevRel con Ň.

  We found that these groups in aggregate, provide exceptional breadth and depth of resources, expertise, and community. However, whether through incentives (ex: revenue-focused) or inclusivity (ex: DevMarketing not included) none felt centralizing enough to be the hub for this initiative, which strives to be open and inclusive, as well as more than just a resource repository.

  We also know that we cannot succeed without the support, involvement, and partnership of the ecosystem of DevRel initiatives, which is why we hope that folks will feel inspired to help build a foundation that codifies the definition and best practices of DevRel; that brings together best-in-class frameworks, training, and resources in a single place; and that attracts individuals and organizations through trust, credibility, and collaboration.
