    <strong>Why a Foundation?</strong>
  </summary><br />

  The major benefit of a foundation is that it promotes participatory governance, preventing any single company from monopolizing a collaborative project. Specifically, a foundation ensures:

  - Community-driven Governance: Projects are managed by the community for the community, with contributions reviewed and accepted based on merit.

  - Open Source: Contributors can use the project's resources without fearing sudden changes in licensing or direction.

  - Impartiality: contributions to the content and direction are accepted based on their community value, regardless of their impact on any particular vendor.

  This initiative stems from a shared passion for DevRel and the recognition that the profession faces persistent challenges, such as a lack of clarity and difficulty in measuring impact. Despite significant growth in resources and organizations addressing these issues, these resources are fragmented. Our goal is to create an inclusive, community-driven entity that formally defines DevRel practices, addresses common challenges with best-in-practice resources, and attracts both individuals and organizations’ decision-makers. A foundation aims to be a trusted, credible, and expert resource, similar to professional bodies in other fields, providing training, certification, continuing education, and advocacy.

    <strong>Why Linux Foundation?</strong>
  </summary><br />

  This collaborative project has been hosted as a [community project][community project], with no funding involved. This means taking advantage of the governance structure, project management staff, and back-end resources that the Linux Foundation (LF) provides to all hosted projects under an unfunded model, to ensure long-term sustainability. Developer Relations Foundation is part of the LF project series, as a [non-profit 501(c)(6)](https://donorbox.org/nonprofit-blog/501c3-vs-501c6). Examples of these projects include [SPDX](https://spdx.dev/) (SBOM Standard), FOSSology, and [CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community/governance/).

  The major benefit of hosting with the LF is that it offers recognized global credibility. Specifically, the LF ensures:

  - **DevRel value outside DevRel**: Being part of a renowned and large open source foundation like the Linux Foundation enhances the project's credibility within the DevRel community and among external stakeholders and decision-makers. This recognition elevates DevRel's visibility and perceived value as a profession, demonstrating its importance and impact beyond industry peers.

  - **Level Playing Field**: Ensuring that no single company in the ecosystem can exert undue control over the project by owning the trademark.

  - **Licensing Integrity**: Protecting the licensing integrity of the collaborative project, as detailed in this [LF blog post][LF blog post].

  The LF allows individual contributors to retain copyright ownership of their contributions while providing an open source license, reflected through the Developer Certificate of Origin sign-off process.
  
  We also chose the LF to avoid reinventing the wheel. Creating something new requires tools, infrastructure, and, ideally, a lightweight process to get started and make the initiative resilient.

## Governance Playbook

The Developer Relations Foundation is a community-driven project, with no funding involved. [This README](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/governance) documents the official DRF Playbook to understand how the Developer Relations Foundation operates and is structured. While the general Charter provides a general overview of the project’s structure and governance, this document covers specific operational details that ensure smooth participation and collaboration. It includes documentation on the DRF community structure, roles, and responsibilities, communication channels, regular meetings, and processes to submit new proposals and start or continue discussions.
